/*
The memmove function is used to copy the first n bytes of th
src memory area to the dst memory area.

In this function, we cast both src and dst to (unsigned char *). 
The reason for this cast is that void * is a generic pointer type and 
doesnâ€™t specify a data type. By casting to (unsigned char *), we ensure 
that both src and dst are treated as byte-level pointers. This allows us 
to copy the data one byte at a time, ensuring precise control over each memory
 location.
Additionally, casting to (unsigned char *) allows us to increment the pointer 
by exactly 1 byte for each iteration, as sizeof(unsigned char) == 1. 
This ensures that we correctly copy each byte in sequence, regardless of the 
original data type of src and dst.
